# .dockerignore - Files/folders to EXCLUDE when copying into the Docker image
# =============================================================================
#
# WHY USE .dockerignore?
# ---------------------
# When Docker runs "COPY . .", it would copy everything in your project. That
# can include large or sensitive files we don't want in the image:
#   - Slower builds, larger images
#   - Risk of copying .env (secrets) or .git (history)
#
# .dockerignore works like .gitignore: list patterns here, and Docker will
# skip them during COPY. Only the rest of the project is copied.
#
# =============================================================================

# Dependencies - we install fresh in the image with "composer install"
# Copying vendor from your PC could cause wrong PHP version or OS-specific files
/vendor

# Version control - not needed to run the app, and can be large
.git
.gitignore

# Environment file - often contains local/dev secrets and DB passwords.
# On Render you set environment variables in the dashboard; don't bake .env
# into the image. If you need a default, use .env.example and copy that.
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Writable contents - logs, cache, session from your PC shouldn't go to image.
# The Dockerfile creates writable/ and sets permissions; we don't need your
# local writable data.
/writable/cache/*
/writable/logs/*
/writable/session/*
/writable/debugbar/*
/writable/uploads/*
# Keep the folder structure (empty dirs). .dockerignore doesn't remove dirs
# created by COPY; we copy app and writable structure. So writable/ exists.
# We just don't copy the contents of those subdirs if we use *.
# Actually with * we're only ignoring contents. The COPY . . will still copy
# writable/.htaccess, writable/index.html etc. and the empty dirs. Good.

# Tests - not needed in production image
/tests

# IDE and OS files
.idea
.vscode
*.swp
*.swo
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Archives and backups - no need in image
*.rar
*.zip
*.tar
*.tar.gz

# Documentation (optional - remove if you want README in image)
# README.md
# *.md
