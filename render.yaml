# =============================================================================
# render.yaml - Render Blueprint (Infrastructure as Code)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS THIS FILE?
# ------------------
# Render can deploy your app by reading this file. It tells Render: "Create a
# Web Service, build it with this Dockerfile, use this start command, set these
# env vars." You can also configure everything in the Render dashboard; this
# file is optional but good for learning and reproducibility.
#
# HOW RENDER USES IT
# ------------------
# When you connect your Git repo to Render, you can choose "Blueprint" and
# point to this file. Render will create the service(s) defined here.
#
# =============================================================================

services:
  # One web service (your CodeIgniter app)
  - type: web

    # Display name in Render dashboard
    name: portfolio

    # Build: use Docker (not native PHP)
    # Render will run: docker build -t ... .
    # So it looks for Dockerfile in the repo root.
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile

    # Region (optional) - pick one close to your users
    # region: oregon

    # Environment variables (set these for production)
    envVars:
      - key: CI_ENVIRONMENT
        value: production
    # IMPORTANT: In Render Dashboard → Environment, add:
    #   app.baseURL = https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com/
    # (Use the exact URL Render gives you after first deploy, with trailing slash)
